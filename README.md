# opencapper-bot

Discord bot for OpenCapper, the verified sports picks platform. Analysts lock picks with
`/pick`, the OpenCapper API captures the odds and grades them, and `/recap` posts the
server's honest record. The bot keeps no database: every read and write goes through the API.

## Commands

| Command                                    | What it does                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/pick sport event market selection units` | Locks a pick at the odds the API captures. `event` autocompletes upcoming games.  |
| `/recap [days]`                            | Record, units and ROI per capper in this server, sorted by units. Default 7 days. |
| `/record [user]`                           | One capper's live record, by Discord id. Default yourself.                        |
| `/leaderboard [sport] [period]`            | Top 10 cappers by ROI (30d, 90d, 1y, all). Default all sports, 30 days.           |
| `/verify pick [user]`                      | Proof page link: a pick id (`123`), or a capper's pick number (`#9`) with `user`. |
| `/capper [user] [name]`                    | Is this capper real? Verified record, or a warning that there is none.            |

`/pick` details:

- `event` matches team words in any order, prefixes, initials (`KC`, `NYG`) and one or two typos
  per word. Text typed without choosing a suggestion resolves to the single best match, or the
  bot lists the candidates. Autocomplete waits at most 2 seconds for the API, then serves the
  last list it has or an "unavailable" row.
- `units` go from 0.5 to 5 in steps of 0.5, the API's shared rule (`UNITS` in
  `src/shared/config/units.ts`). Checked before any API call.
- One pick attempt per user every 15 seconds, before the API's own per user limit.
- Every check that needs no odds (units, cooldown, event, started) answers privately before
  the reply is deferred. An API error after that replaces the public reply and deletes itself
  after a minute.

## Results feed

Every 5 minutes the bot asks the API for picks settled in each server since the last post and
posts one result embed per pick (win, loss, push or void, units won or lost, captured vs
closing odds and CLV when known) into the first text channel whose name contains
`RESULTS_CHANNEL` (default `results`), at most 50 per tick. Servers without such a channel are
skipped. The watermark per server is `{ since, seen }`: grading stamps a whole batch with one
time, so it keeps the ids already posted at `since` and asks the API from 1 ms earlier. It lives
in memory and in `DATA_DIR/results-watermarks.json` (default `/app/data`, a named docker
volume), so restarts do not repost. A server is first polled from
the moment the bot sees its results channel, never backfilled. A 404 from the endpoint is
treated as not deployed yet and skipped quietly.

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN and BOT_API_TOKEN
bun install
bun dev
```

Set `DEV_GUILD_ID` to register slash commands on one server instantly instead of globally.
Set `DATA_DIR=./data` locally; the default `/app/data` only exists in the container.

## API contract

Base `OPENCAPPER_API_URL` (default `https://opencapper.coding-global.com/api`). Every request
sends `Authorization: Bearer <BOT_API_TOKEN>`. Errors return a non 2xx status with
`{ "error": "message" }`; the message is shown to the user as is. Types live in `src/lib/api.ts`.
`POST /picks` answers 429 once the API's daily odds budget for user picks is spent and 503 while
it keeps its remaining Odds API credits for grading; both carry a readable `error`.

| Method | Path                                   | Response              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | `/events?sport=<sportKey>`             | `ApiEvent[]`          |
| POST   | `/picks` (body `CreatePickRequest`)    | `ApiPick`             |
| GET    | `/recap?guildId=&from=&to=` (ISO 8601) | `RecapResponse`       |
| GET    | `/picks/settled?guildId=&since=` (ISO) | `ApiSettledPick[]`    |
| GET    | `/leaderboard?sport=&period=&sort=roi` | `LeaderboardResponse` |
| GET    | `/check?q=<query>`                     | `CapperCheck`         |
| GET    | `/check/discord/:discordId`            | `CapperCheck`         |

`ApiEvent` and `ApiPick` carry optional `homeImage`, `awayImage` (absolute image URLs) and
`homeCountry`, `awayCountry` (short codes such as `USA`). The pick and result embeds use the
picked side's image as thumbnail (home when the selection names no side) and show countries
next to the names.

`/picks/settled` returns picks of that guild whose `settledAt` is strictly after `since`,
oldest first, result not `pending`, disqualified picks (locked at or after the real start)
left out. `ApiPick` may carry `disqualified: { actualStart }` (ISO); the feed skips such a pick
if one ever arrives. `ApiSettledPick` is `ApiPick` plus `settledAt` (ISO),
`closingOdds` (American, optional) and `clv` (fraction like `roi`, optional). Odds are
American; units won on a win are `units * odds / 100` (plus odds) or `units * 100 / |odds|`.

`/leaderboard`: `sport` is a sport group (`americanfootball`, `basketball`, `baseball`,
`icehockey`, `soccer`, `tennis`, `golf`, `mma`, `boxing`, `cricket`, `aussierules`, `rugby`,
the API's `SPORT_GROUPS`), not an Odds API sport key, and omitted for all sports, `period` is `30d`, `90d`,
`1y` or `all`. Response `{ rows, minGraded, total }`, rows `{ rank, username, picks, graded,
wins, losses, pushes, units, unitsRisked, roi, sports }` sorted by the API. A 404 shows
"The leaderboard is coming soon."

`/capper`: `user` resolves by Discord id only (`/check/discord/:discordId`), never by name, since
a same named account elsewhere is exactly what impersonators use. `name` goes to `/check?q=`,
the same lookup as the web page `/check`: OpenCapper username, Discord username or id,
Telegram username, Polymarket wallet or name, Reddit name, or a pasted profile link. Response
`{ query, matches }`, at most 5 matches, best first. A match carries `username`, `avatarUrl`,
`matchedBy`, `status` (`member`, `imported`, `claimed`), `platform`, `claimedBy`, `live` (a
`CheckRecord` plus `pending`), `history` (on chain, or null), `total` (live plus history) and
`lastPickAt` (ISO or null). `CheckRecord` is `{ graded, wins, losses, pushes, units,
unitsRisked, roi }`. Hidden profiles never match. No match replies "No verified OpenCapper
record for @user" with the warning and a link to the web check. The endpoint is public and rate
limited per IP; requests with the bot token skip the limit.

`/record` resolves by Discord id (`/check/discord/:discordId`) and shows the first match's
`live` record. No match, or a 404, replies a neutral "No OpenCapper record" without the
verified footer.

`ApiPick.id` is the global pick id, the one `WEBSITE_URL/en/verify?pick=<id>` reads; every
embed links with it and shows it next to the per capper number (`#12 (id 14)`). `/verify 14`
needs no API call. `/verify #9 [user]` looks the capper up by Discord id (default the caller)
and links `/en/verify?user=<username>&seq=9`.

## Deploy

Komodo stack on the Netcup box: Komodo clones this repo and runs `docker compose build` and
`up`. Runtime env comes from the stack's `.env`. The Dockerfile builds a single Bun binary on
distroless for amd64 or arm64.
